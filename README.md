## Abstract
Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) from the sun is a natural daytime stressor for vertebrates in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. UVR effects on the physiology of vertebrates manifest at the cellular level, but have bottom-up effects at the tissue-level and on whole-animal performance and behaviours. Climate change and habitat loss (i.e., loss of shelter from UVR) could interact with and exacerbate the genotoxic and cytotoxic impacts of UVR on vertebrates. Therefore, it is important to understand the range and magnitude of effects that UVR can have on a diversity of physiological metrics, and how these may be shaped by taxa, life stage or geographic range in the major vertebrate groups. A number of processes such as growth, locomotion, oxidative damage to cells and DNA damage are consistently negatively impacted by UVR. Using a meta-analytical approach, we used 895 observations from 47 different vertebrate species (fish, amphibian, reptile, and bird), and 51 physiological metrics (i.e., cellular, tissue and whole-animal metrics), across 73 independent studies, to elucidate the general patterns of UVR effects on vertebrate physiology. We found that while UVRâ€™s impacts on vertebrates are generally negative, fish and amphibians were the most susceptible taxa, adult and larvae were the most susceptible life stages, and animals inhabiting temperate and tropical latitudes were the most susceptible to UVR stress. This information is critical to further our understanding of the adaptive capacity of vulnerable taxon to UVR stress, and the wide-spread sub-lethal physiological effects of UVR on vertebrates, such as DNA damage and cellular stress, which may translate up to impaired growth and locomotor performance. These impairments to individual fitness highlighted by our study may potentially cause disruptions at the ecosystem-scale, especially if the effects of this pervasive diurnal stressor are exacerbated by climate change and reduced refuge due to habitat loss and degradation.
